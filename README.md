# README

I wrote a simple bash script that makes my camera ping pong around my room. This script as written will only work on my system, but I'm confident that with some gumption you could get it working on your computer, too.

You'll need a command line interface for your webcam. On Linux, you probably have v4l2 installed, and that'll work just fine.

You'll also need a webcam that support tilt and zoom. I'm using the Logitech C922 Pro Stream. It's well reviewed.
